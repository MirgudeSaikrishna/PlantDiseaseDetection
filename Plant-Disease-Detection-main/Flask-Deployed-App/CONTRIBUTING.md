## üß™ **Testing Guidelines**

### **Unit Tests**
```python
# Example test structure
def test_disease_detection():
    # Arrange
    test_image = "test_images/healthy_leaf.jpg"
    
    # Act
    result = predict_disease(test_image)
    
    # Assert
    assert result['confidence'] > 0.8
    assert 'healthy' in result['disease_name'].lower()
```

### **Integration Tests**
```python
def test_api_endpoint():
    # Test API endpoint
    response = client.post('/api/detect', data={'image': test_file})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert 'disease_name' in response.json
```

## üìö **Documentation Standards**

### **Code Documentation**
```python
def predict_disease(image_path: str, location: str = None) -> Dict:
    """
    Predict plant disease from image.
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the input image
        location (str, optional): Geographic location for weather context
        
    Returns:
        Dict: Prediction results including disease name, confidence, and treatment plan
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If image file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If image format is not supported
    """
```

### **API Documentation**
```yaml
/api/detect:
  post:
    summary: Detect plant disease
    parameters:
      - name: image
        in: formData
        type: file
        required: true
        description: Plant leaf image
    responses:
      200:
        description: Successful detection
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            disease_name:
              type: string
            confidence:
              type: number
```
